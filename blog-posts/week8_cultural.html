			<h1>Conflict and the Compass of Shame</h1>

			<p>I really try hard not to have too much open conflict with people that I deal with.  One time that I did was in high-school when a group of senior would routinely try to pick on freshman students.  Eventually they made my way to me and I told myself that I wouldnâ€™t let myself be bullied so I ended up retaliating a lot more than I probably should have when they tried to make fun of me.  I ended up getting into a big fight with one of the seniors and getting suspended from school for three days because of it.  I think if I had a chance to do it over I would probably try to bring up the bullying to teachers before it got out of control instead of retaliating and escalating the situation.   I learned that there maybe other ways to handle conflict if you are upfront about it instead of waiting until it escalates and over-reacting.</p>
