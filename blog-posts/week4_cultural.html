		<h1>Slow down to catch up</h1>

		<p>In the tech world, everything is fast.  Programs are designed to run as fast as possible.  Tight deadlines are set so that new software is developed and released quickly.   This do everything fast mentality extends all the way down into how tech is taught.  Many students in college aren't encouraged to take their time and really learn the craft.  They are pushed through the college's program, a program that has had the same structure for the past 30 years, without truly making sure they are ready for the workforce.  While many students make it through this process and become great developers, there are students who don't learn as fast and maybe end up dropping out of the program all together because they canâ€™t keep up.  This is especially true if that student didn't have access to development tools or was never encouraged to learn development on their own before they got to college.  Typically, lower-income schools don't have computer labs or coding classes at all, which means that entire classes of students miss out on learning about a great field that could lead to personal and professional satisfaction.</p>   
		
		<p>Programming has always had the stigma that only extremely smart people can do it.  While it does take a level of competence in order to become a proficient developer, a lot of that competence can be developed with practice. I believe that colleges should encourage students that struggle with initial math and CS concepts to stick to it, maybe placing them on a five to six year plan in order to give them ample time to catch up.  Doing this will have the overall benefit of eventually producing more developers available at a time when many companies say that they have trouble keeping a full dev team.   It will also put students in a better position for long term career growth.  A slightly older student with a CS degree will probably have better career prospects than a student who was able to graduate in four years with a humanities degree.</p>  

		<p>Slowing down the teaching process will make technology a more accessible career-field, which would most likely lead to the increased diversity that many of the top tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter suffer from.   I think it would take a combined effort from tech companies working with institutions and government entities to encourage more people to go into the tech field, and take their time to get it right. </p>
