		<h1> Paring is Caring</h1>

		<img src = "../unit1_projects/images/pair.jpg" id= "image">


		<p>I feel that pairing while paring with others does have it's cons, two brains working togeather is usually better than one and it ultimatly hleps you write better code.  One of the biggest things that paring helps with is eliminating simple mistakes.  When writing code by yourself, you could easilly mistype a key, finish your program, then spend time having to go back though the program to find out why it didn't work.  Typically when you are pairing and type in the wrong thing, your pair will probably see it right away and make you aware that you typed y instead of x.   Also, pairing helps you actually think through a challenge in order to come up with a good plan of attack. </p>

		<p>Getting feedback is in interesting experience.  It can really give you an idea of what the other person you paired with is thinking and can help you to adjust how you pair in the future.  The biggest thing that I've learned from my feedback is that it helps to be prepared before you go into a pairing session so that you don't use time reading over a challenge when the other person is ready to go.</p>
