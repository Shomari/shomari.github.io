		<h1>Values</h1>

		<h3>When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Autonomy</li>
			<li>helping other people</li>
			<li>loyalty</li>
			<li>tranquility</li>
			<li>Security</li></ul>


<h3>Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.</h3>
<p>One of the proudest moments of my life was when I was finally able to move out of my parents home into my own apartment.  I felt like after a long time, I was now able to take care of myself and did not have to depend on others to care for me.</p>

<h3>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:</h3>
<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

<ul>
	<li>Autonomy- 4</li>
	<li>Helping other people - 4</li>
	<li>Loyalty- 5</li>
	<li>tranquility -3</li>
	<li>Security - 4</li>
	</ul>

<h3>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?</h3>
<p>The last topic that someone asked me for advice on was if they should break-up with their girlfriend.  I told him to really examine what he wanted out of life and if she wasnâ€™t fitting what she wanted, then he should let her go.</p>


<h3>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h3>
<p>I think my values help me a great deal when dealing with stereotype threat.  I value Autonomy very high, and I see DBC as a tool to use to help me land a career in which I can provide for myself and not have to do things because others are helping me.  This value also ties in with security, as I want to be secure in my future and know that I will always be able to provide for myself and others.  I can use these values to fight stereotype threat because whenever I get down, I remember what I am going through this for and can refocus so that I can achieve my goals.</p>
