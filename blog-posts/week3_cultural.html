		<h1> Learning and Thinking Styles</h1>

		<p>Statistically, the results of the quiz is that I identify with concrete sequential thinking the most.  I do feel this is somewhat accurate, however when doing some research on the traits of various learning styles, I could easily see myself with traits from each of the learning styles.  One of my biggest strengths is that I can adopt to a wide range of situations and people.  I believe that this is why I see such a mix of taits that could apply to me.</p>

		<p>The biggest way that this can help me during DBC is to adjust my learning style to whatever I feel works the best.  I learn extremely well from trial and error.    Learning this way sometimes hurts because I make a lot of initial mistakes, but I find that I am able to quickly recover from them, and I absorb lessos better if I do something wrong and correct it rather than spending a lot of time reading beforehand and trying to get it right the first time.     I realize that due to the fast-paced nature of DBC, I may need to cut down on the trial-and-error type learning as I might not have enough time to go back through and learn from my mistakes.   Always keeping this thought in mind will help me to approach certain challenges a little differently, or rely on working with my peers in order to get a challenge solved successfully on the first try.</p> 

		<p>I have not really struggled with anything major so far.  I have had a little bit of a tough time understanding a few JavaScript concepts but I feel like I am getting though it and feeling more comfortable with it.   My overall plan is to attack each week (and each day once classes start) and try to learn and get everything done as soon as I can, so that I can spend some time later on going over what I learned and really making sure I internalized the lessons being taught.  </p>
