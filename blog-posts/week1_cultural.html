			<p>Watching Shereef's video pretty much confirmed my impressions of what DBC was.  After initially hearing about DBC, I was really skeptical and did a ton of research on the program before hand.  I reached out to as many graduates that I could find in order to ask them about their experience.  Everyone I talked ot was very happy with the course and helped to set my expectations for how it would work.   I knew that team-work and pairing would be a huge part of the program and Shereef reinforced that notion.  I think (hope?)  I will fit in well with this type of culture.  I like to consider myself a very social person and I am excited to get the chance to develop relationships with people who also love something that I love.  It will be fun to work with a group that has a common objective.  It also excites me that I will have people there that can help me if I get stuck and that I will have the ability.  As far as emotions go, I wouldn't really say that I'm nervous, more excited to get started.  I'm very confident that I will be able to pick up the materials and can't wait to start this new chapter in my life.  </p>
