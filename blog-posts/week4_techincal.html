				<h1>Enum# Cycle</h1>

				<img src = "../unit1_projects/images/ruby_enum.jpg" id= "image">

			<p>On it's surface,  the cycle method seems similar to the each method.  Both are good ways to iterate through an array or hash while performing some type of code for each element.   When comparing the Ruby docs for both methods,  I had a difficult time understanding why  you would use one over the other.  I then noticed a couple of features of cycle that could come in handy in certain situations.</p>

			<h3>Cycle features</h3>

			<p>What was the big revelation?  Cycle returns nil if the loop has finished without getting interrupted.   This opens up a wide range of possibilities that you can use as a test  to see if something is making your loop stop before it reaches the end.  You could put in <i>break if</i> statements, then run the method.  If the method returns nil, you would know that it got through the whole cycle.  If not, then you know that one of your break if conditions tirggered and stopped the cycle form completing.  While I am sure there are probably complex real world situationis in which this would be useful, I had a hard time thinking of a specific example.  Instead, I used a simple example based on the second feature of cycle.</p>

			<p>Cycle's second big feature is that you can directly tell cycle how many times you want it to go through your array. If you leave the parameter empty, then cycle will continue to loop through the array ....<strong>FOREVER!!!!</strong>  Obviously, we would never want that, so it is always a great idea to put how many times you want cycle to go through your hash or array.  A quick example of how this could be helpful is if you have an array of strings and you want to repeat  the array in order a certain amount of times.  Let's say you are Batman and you want to badger Bane until he gives you the location of the override device.  You could do something like:</p>

			<p id= "code"><samp> batman = ["WHERE ", "IS ", "IT?!?! "]<br>
			batman.cycle(3)  {|x| puts x} <br>
			==> "WHERE IS IT?!?! WHERE IS IT?!?! WHERE IS IT?!?! "   </samp></p>
