				<h1>Method to my Madness</h1>

				<img src = "../unit1_projects/images/method_man.jpg" id= "image">

			<p>Methods are the muscles of our ruby classes.  Much like our muscles help our body to do the things we want, methods help our programs to do the things that we want.   Just like we have different types of muscles (fast-twitch vs slow-twitch), there are also two different types of methods that have different requirements and different uses.</p>

			<p>Instance methods, as their name implies, are methods that are run on an instance of a class. The majority of methods you make will most likely be instance methods so that you can manipulate objects that you create.    To run an instance method, you must first create an object first, then run the method on that object:</p>

			<p id= "code"><samp> class Example <br>
    			def show #instance variable <br>
        			puts "This is an instance example!" <br>
    			end <br>
			end <br>

			learn = Example.new <br>
			learn.show => "This is an instance example" </samp></p>

			<p>Class methods, don't require you to create an object first and can just be ran on the class.  When creating class methods, simply put 'self.' in front of the method name and you will have a class method:</p>

			<p id= "code"><samp> class Example <br>
    			def self.show <br>
        			puts "This is a class method example" <br>
    			end <br>
			end <br> <br>

			Example.show => "This is a class method example" </samp></p>

			<p>As stated before, the majority of the time you are going to use instance methods to manipulate data.  The reason is because many times you will want to perform more than one function on an object, and you can't do that just using class methods.  I know it may seem like using class methods is a little bit easier going of my extremely simple example, but it most real-world applications, instance methods are the way to go unless you have an entire class dedicated to doing blanket function.</p>

			<p>The image is method man if you weren't aware :) </p>
