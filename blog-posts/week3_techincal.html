			<h1>What is the most popular language in web development and why is it JavaScript?</h1>

			<img src = "../images/js.png" id= "image">

<p>In recent years, JavaScript has exploded into the scene in the web development world.  The big question is why has it become some popular in web development.</p>

<h2> No Compiler needed </h2>

	<p>One of the biggest advantages that JavaScript has going for it is that it is ran directly inside of web browsers like Chrome and Firefox.  Unlike Ruby or C+, JavaScript doesn't have to be compiled.  This helps web pages load and run faster because everything is handled in the browser.  Also, JavaScript can be created with a simple text editor and doesn't need a resource heavy compiler or IDE to run.</p>

<h2> Easy to learn (relatively) </h2>
	<p>In addition to not having to download and setup a bunch of programs to even begin developing, JavaScript has a lot of resources on the internet to help even the most novice programmer get up and running quickly.  JS also has a wide range of powerful libraries, like jQuery, to support developers.</p>


<h2>Standardized</h2>
	<p>Probably the biggest reason why JS is the top language in web development is because it is fairly standard and consistent across all major web browsers.  Everything from Safari to Opera uses JS in pretty much the same way. </p> 

<h1>Limitations</h1>

	<p>While there are many great reasons to use JavaScript for web development, there are some limitations to JavaScript. One of the biggest is that JS cannot access databases directly.  A database is the backbone of most webapps.  Information from the database needs to be accessed and displayed in order to have a functioning app.   
	Lastly, there are some security issues with JavaScript as well.  JS cannot protect page source or images.  Any images displayed are downloaded on the client's computer, so they have the ability to save those images and do what they please with them.</p>

<h1>Wrap-up</h1>

	<p>The limitations listed do not take away from JavaScript being one of the best languages for front end web development.  Most of the issues facing JS can be easily fixed by using one of the many programming languages out there.   The fact that JavaScript is the web standard across virtually all web browsers will ensure that it will be the go-to front-end language for companies looking to develop dynamic web applications.</p>
