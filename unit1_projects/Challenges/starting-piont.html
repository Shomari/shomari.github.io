      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>

      Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience.  It should provide easy reading and navigation with a minimum of resizing, panning, and scrollingâ€”across a wide range of devices (from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors). <sup>1</sup>      
      
      Responsive design is designing one web page to be easily viewable on multiple screen sizes.<sup>2</sup></p>

    <div class="fluid-layouts">
      <h2>Fluid Layouts</h2>
      <p>Include information about fluid layouts you found. Add html tags where necessary. You can copy and paste your info here, but be sure to add a number and add the site to the references div below!<br><br>
      
      Liquid or fluid layout dimensions are defined in percentages, and as you might expect,
      this affords greater malleability and fluidity. <sup>3</sup></p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p> Discuss the purpose of responsive design and fluid layouts and whether you think it's good practice to use them.Add html tags where necessary.<br><br>
      
      Yes we think that responsive design and fluid layouts are good practice because it makes your website more accessible to muiltiple devices.  Statistics show that as of now 30% off all web-traffic comes from mobile devices.  It is crucial for any site to cater to all forms of technology.  <sup>4</sup></p>

    <div class="reflection">
      <h2>Shomari's Reflection</h2>
      Add html tags where necessary to make the information make sense. 
      You don't need to keep these questions visible.
      <ul>
        <li>How was it to implement these concepts?</li>
        <p>. Responsive web design is the process of having websites render correctly no matter what type of device or viewport the user is on.  I do like it because it is clear that we are moving more and more into a mobile world with a verity of devices to vew the web on.  It is good practice to have a responsive web site because you can be confident that no matter where a user is coming from, they are going to have a good user experiance. </p>

        <li>How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?</li> 
        <p>2. The portability of smartphones is what really changed the web.  No longer are people sitting at a desk when veiwing the web.  People use the web for information when they are on the go and the internet has to make adjustments to that.  Web practices will have to continually keep up with the newest techonlogy. As mobile matures and newer tech, like Google glass and wearable devices become more and more prominient. </p>

        <li>How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?</li> 
        <p>3.  I'm not sure how someone who is fully visually impaired is able to use the web.  I think that partially impared people may have trouble seeing different colors and that when we are designing we should keep them in mind when picking what color schemes to use. </p>


        <li>What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?</li> 
        <p> 4. So far, I really like the use of semantic tags in HTML5 instead of endless divs.  I feel that I have a basic understanding of most of the concepts, the biggest issue is getting them to stick and to develop a deeper understanding of them.</p>
