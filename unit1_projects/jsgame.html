	<h1> Find the Cheese! </h1>
	<p> You are a hungry mouse looking for cheese that is buried somewhere on a 10 x 10 grid.  Clicking Move mouse runs the move() function, and will move your mouse to the x and y coordinates that you put in.  Run the dig() function by clicking "Dig at your location" to see if the cheese is in that spot.  If not, you will know how close you are to the cheese and you will be over to move again.  WARNING: There is a vicious cat looking for you and you only have time to dig in three places.  If you dig a fourth time, you will be devoured.</p>

<!--  Reflection
	My strategy was to come up with a simple game that would run functions to manipulate objects. 
	2.  My biggest question was on how to incorporate JS into an HTML file to make a real webpage that can be used.
	3. No trouble with any concepts yet
	4. I learned how to incorporate Javascript code into HTML
	5.  I enjoyed creating this game and going through the process of making it live.  I plan to continue working on it.
	6.  Nothing was really tedious about the challenge.  Maybe having to consistently find correct syntax for different results that I was wanted.
