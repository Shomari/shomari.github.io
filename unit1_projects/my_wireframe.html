I always had a fondness for websites that had minimal design and that is what I am going for with my blog.  I want something that is easy to read and very clean.  I will focus on using good fonts and typorgraphy to make the site more readable. 

My plan is to have a simple navigation bar on the top of the page that will take you to different sections of the site.  Content will be featured on the right side 2/3rds of the page.  On the left third, I will have a funny youtube video just to bring some lightness to the site.  I'll also have an archive box in which people can use to get to old posts.
