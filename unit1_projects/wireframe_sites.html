		<p>ESPN is probably the biggest sports website in the world and thus it has a log of challnegs that it tries to solve on its homepage.  First off, lots of different types of people go to ESPN for specific infomration on the sports that they care about.  At the very top of the page, they present menu bars that can quickly direct a person to the sport that they are interested in.  The site also has to present information on the top stories of the moment to people who just want to know what is going on.  Lastly, since it is a business, the site needs to find a way to put advertiser content in, without taking away from the user experiance.  Taking care of all of these concerns on one page in a way that is still visually pleasing is a huge challenge that I feel like the website sucessfully navagates. </p>
