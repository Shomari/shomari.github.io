          <p>There are tons of examples and blog posts on the web of people sharing their bad experience when practising pair programming. There are thousands of stories of how evil pairing is and how wrong it is for creativity[1,3].

Let’s stop this. I believe that those stories exist, because people have no idea how to practice pair programming.

No one was born the best programmer in the world. People who are believed to be ones, gained their knowledge through hard-work, experience and hours spent on coding. The same goes with Pair Programming and social skills in general. Everyone needs some training.

Let’s consider some of the most important rules [5]:

Pairs should be formed flexibly and naturally, rather than by fixed assignment.
Keep fresh perspective by switching your partner frequently.
Sit comfortably (with plenty of space for your feet and arms) side by side.
Always use a big monitor (or more) and two keyboards.
Collaborate with your partner, do not critique his work</p>

          <p>
              Few or no bugs: The first thing you will notice when pair programming is how few bugs are left in code produced by the pair. Pair programming is like a constant code review process, which is why typos or small details that a single programmer normally wouldn’t notice gets spotted almost instantly by the navigator, eliminating hours of debugging later on.

Code quality: The general quality of the code is also greatly increased. This is because while the driver is implementing the logic, the navigator is free both to spot errors and to think about the big picture and how it relates to the rest of the code.

Programmer productivity: When working alone it is very easy to get distracted by email, twitter, Facebook, and all the things going on within the office. When working in pairs, if you were to do any of those things it would waste the other person’s time, so pair programming is a constant reminder to focus on the work.

Knowledge transfer: In an environment where developers work alone, it can be hard to share knowledge because there often isn’t a time or place to do it. Pair programming involves constant discussion and flow of ideas on how to resolve a problem, and normally a pair can come up with many different solutions to a single problem. It’s also great in situations where you want to introduce a new team member, to get them up to speed very quickly with the development practices, coding style, git workflow and other practices the developers might use.

          <p>Ed's thoughts
          I personally enjoy paired programming.  It allows me to step outside of my comfort zone and gain perspectives outside of my own.  I gain an extra pair of eyes to challenge my thoughts, critique my work, and improve my coding.  </p>

          <p>Shomari's thoughts
          I think that paired programming is an important tool in development because it allows for mutiple ideas to be developed when trying to solve a problem.  It allows for knowledge to be transfered between two people and helps them both to become better developers. </p>
